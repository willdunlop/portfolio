A portfolio website intended for demonstrating the capabilites of William Dunlop

#Intended Audience

This website has been designed and built for the purpose of illustrating both my skills and personality. As such, the intended audience of this website is any individual or company who has an interest in my capabilities and is looking to use the skills I have to offer.

#Design

- The website was designed with the intention of being both simple and aesthetic. I started of with a dark theme that had bright orange highlights in certain places but i could not get it to appear the way I intended and found that these highlights would clash with the readability of text in certain places. With this in mind I decided to build it's theme around one of my animation projects known as Hill Town instead. With this being the sites theme I was able to introduce a calm atmosphere to its overall feel with the background showing a simple low poly forest environment with a small village in the distance during the peaceful hours of sunset. 

- The navbar was constructed from scratch and went through many different variations. Originally it contained an image from a project I worked on several months ago in order to match the dark theme but this later changed to an isometric perspective of a Hill Town environment and then again to another Hill Town image of the sun shining through some trees. It also contains large buttons appropriatley labled to assist with site navigation. When browsing to the mobile site a much simpler navbar appears instead of the one a user encounters on the desktop site. This decision was made to avoid occupying to much space on smaller mobile screens.

- The landing page contains a large slideshow that immediatley demonstrates to the audience the type of work I am capable of. This to me is a quick yet detailed summary of my work for anyone who has browsed to this website. 

- On the "Work" page I go into further detail about projects I have been apart of and skills i am in the process of gaining. Ive placed images and brief summaries of these projects in white transparent borderless boxes that cast a shadow onto the background behind them. The shadow elevates the boxes giving the sense of a foreground where the user can apply their attention. Upon hovering over these boxes the colour theme completley changes prompting the audience to click. Upon doing so they are then led to a sub page containing more insight into what the project was about. It's on these pages that a user can hover over certain images in order to increase their size for clearer visibilty. This action is seamless and smooth and adds a sense of interactivity for the audience to enjoy.

- The "About" page maintains the theme using the same borderless box containing information in regards to the kind of person i am and the skills that i have. On the right side of the box is my sites logo which is the same as the favicon only larger and easier to see. 

- On the "Contact" page I have decided to use imagery to indicate the various means a user can get in touch by supplying links to my LinkedIn and GitHub with the use of their respective logos. Below this is a contacts form that a user can interact with in order to send me an enquiry directly. 

#Heuristics

 
  Consistency and Standards

I have carefully designed the website with consistency in mind. All elements on the site maintain the same design so as to allow for their identification. A heading looks different to a body of text to distinguish their purpose on the page but all headings will look the same. The same is applied to links, boxes, buttons and images.

  Recognition Rather than Recall

With the use of hover effects and specific design decisions the audience will be able to navigate the website without any instruction. This helps to create a positive user experience that is clear and easy to understand.

  Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

I have used image optimisation to allow for quick loading of the website. While maintaining the quality within my images, this process has also reduced their demand upon download speeds and use of resources.

  Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Both minimalistic design and aesthetic have been considered throughout the entire duration of this project. Using techniques such as imagery, transparency, spacing and more I have been able to maintain both of these factors consistantly accross the entire website.

#Personal Logo

The logo i designed for this website was taken from my hilltown project in order to maintain the theme. It is based around the house found on the hill which I consider an iconic part of that project. I used photoshop in order to edit it by placing several extra effects such as a bevel, outline, outer glow, increase in brightness and contrast as well as my initials superimposed on the the ceiling.
