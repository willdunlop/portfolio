  <p>My name is William Dunlop and I am a web developer, software developer and
    3D Animator. Since I was very young I have had an interest in video games,
    2D and 3D animation, computer, technology, science and art. These interests have
    remained a part of my life for as long as i can remember and will continue to do
    so. Web and software development are skills that I am currently learning through
    a Diploma of Software Development. It is very quickly becoming my passion and
    will be what i use to build my future.
    As well as this I have also built on skills in regards to 2D and 3D Animation by
    completing a bachelors degree in Interactive Entertainment with Animation being the major.
    These skills include 3D Moddeling, Uv unwrapping, character rigging, texturing,
    animating, setting up complex renders, level design, games design and much more.
    I am very knowledgeable with programs
    such as Maya, Photoshop and Bitmap 2 Material and am currently in the process
    of learning Unreal Engine 4, Adobe Flash, Substance Designer and Quixel's Ddo.</p>
